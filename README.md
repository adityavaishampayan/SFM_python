## Introduction

In this project we reconstruct a 3D scene and simultaneously obtain the camera poses of a monocular camera w.r.t. the given scene. This procedure is known as Structure from Motion (SfM). As the name suggests, you are creating the entire rigid structure from a set of images with different view points (or equivalently a camera in motion).

A few years ago, Agarwal et. al published Building Rome in a Day in which they reconstructed the entire city just by using a large collection of photos from the Internet.

There are a few steps that collectively form SfM:

  - Feature Matching and Outlier rejection using RANSAC
  - Estimating Fundamental Matrix
  - Estimating Essential Matrix from Fundamental Matrix
  - Estimate Camera Pose from Essential Matrix
  - Check for Cheirality Condition using Triangulation
  - Perspective-n-Point
     - Linear Camera Pose Estimation
     - PnP RANSAC
     - Nonlinear PnP
  - Bundle Adjustment
     - Visibility Matrix

## Development Process
This module will be developed using the Solo Iterative Process(SIP), Test Driven Development and agile development in a 3 week sprint method.
The spreadsheet for the Product log, iteration backlog, work log and sprint details can be found in this link-[Agile Development Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gTq1l9RCe6zuMW0L57cpaaCt8EEMOVuNtgeplXd2HEI/edit?usp=sharing)

Notes from the sprint review sessions can be found in the link-[Sprint review Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T2uCC2Ef_-l1TtSUzq2ocHxJed9Jsc1g0zjSTBZt-sQ/edit?usp=sharing)

```

Sources go in [src/](src/), header files in [include/](include/), main programs in [app/](app), and
tests go in [tests/](tests/) (compiled to `unit_tests` by default).

If you add a new executable, say `app/hello.cpp`, you only need to add the following two lines to [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt):

``` cmake
add_executable(main app/main.cpp)   # Name of exec. and location of file.
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE ${LIBRARY_NAME})  # Link the executable to lib built from src/*.cpp (if it uses it).
```

You can find the example source code that builds the `main` executable in [app/main.cpp](app/main.cpp) under the `Build` section in [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt).
If the executable you made does not use the library in [src/](src), then only the first line is needed.

## Dependencies
Simple starter C++ project with:

- OpenCV - (OpenCV uses a BSD license and hence can be used for production with modification to the code.)

## Running tests-
Go to Catkin Workspace
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make run_tests intelli_bot_test
```

## Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:

``` bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./main
> make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```


## Setup
When starting a new project, you probably don't want the history of this repository. To start fresh you can use
the [setup script](setup.sh) as follows:
``` bash
> git clone https://github.com/bsamseth/cpp-project  # Or use ssh-link if you like.
> cd cpp-project
> sh setup.sh
```
The result is a fresh Git repository with one commit adding all files from the boiler plate.

## Doxygen Documentation

The doxygen documentation can be generated manually using the following commands
-

Installation
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
```
Open Doxywizard and follow the instructions to generate the required files
```
doxywizard
```
Or one can also follow the steps given below:

Doxygen Documentation generation steps:
```
cd <path to repository>
mkdir Doxygen
cd Doxygen
doxygen -g <config_file_name>
```

Open configuration file and update the following:

```
PROJECT_NAME = 'your project name'
INPUT = ../LaneDetector ../include ../test
```

Run and generate the documents by running the next command:
```
doxygen <config_file_name>
```
